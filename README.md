CSE 360 Group 8 Project

This project is not for use by anyone NOT in Group 8 of the Fall 2015 CSE 360 class with Dr. Yau. If you are not one
of the collaborators added as part of Group 8 in the class you are NOT allowed to use any of the code that has been
committed as this is an academic integrity violation. We are not responsible for anyone who breaks this rule as we
are explicitly NOT giving anyone else permission to write or copy our code for this project.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
The Members of Group 8
